* A smart way of porting dotfiles!

This repository is one smart way of porting dotfiles between machines,
and keeping your configuration of Emacs version controlled. 
 
** Credits 
The content of this repository (and this file) is mostly based on [[https://github.com/hrs/dotfiles][Harry R. Schwartz's]]
excellent configuration, adapted to my needs. Be prepared for that! 


** Installation
Clone this repository wherever you like (I use =~/.dotfiles=) and run the
=install.sh= script. This will:

- Install a bunch of Debian packages,
- Set up a bunch of symlinks in your home directory to the content in
  the dotfiles-folder (e.g., =~/.bashrc= â†’
  =~/.dotfiles/bash/.bashrc=), and
- Install a handful of required Ruby gems.

I'm currently working on an Ubuntu 20.04 so my set-up might not work
for you. 

**** Wallpaper
To ensure that wallpaper is set correctly, create a =~/.wallpaper-directory=
symlink to the directory where you keep your wallpapers:

#+begin_src
$ ln -s /where/your/wallpapers/live ~/.wallpaper-directory
#+end_src
